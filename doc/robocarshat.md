# DIYRobocarsFr Hat

DIYRobocarsFr Hat is a daughter board (Hat) for Raspberry Pi or Nvidia Jeston Nano or any other SBC with Raspberry compatible GPIO to ease the built of autonomous small scale RC-style car like the Donkey car. You can find more about DIYRobocarsFr Hat here :

- [hardware](https://github.com/btrinite/robocars_hat_hw)

#### Main changes to integrate RobocarsHat :
- new part : [robocars_hat_ctrl.py](./donkeycar/parts/robocars_hat_ctrl.py) with new Class RobocarsHatInCtrl, which is both a part to add support for receiving throttle and steering command from an RC Receiver and also act as low level driver between raspberry pi/jetson nano and the hat (to control the serial port). The controler part is enabled by setting USE_ROBOCARSHAT_AS_CONTROLLER configuation key to True.
- updated [actuator.py](./donkeycar/parts/actuator.py) with a new Class RobocarsHat that is used to send throttle and steering orders to the hat, enabled by setting DRIVE_TRAIN_TYPE configuration key to ROBOCARSHAT.
- new set of config parameters (search ROBOCARSHAT)
- update [complete.py](./donkeycar/templates/complete.py) with instantiation of RobocarsHatInCtrl and RobocarsHat accordingly to configuration.

Warning : for Raspberry pi 3, you have to get rid of 'miniuart' and resplace it by the true UART device known as PL011.
You will most likely lose Bluetooth. You can check [here](https://www.circuits.dk/setup-raspberry-pi-3-gpio-uart/)
#### Configuration

Configuration keys are:
- enable Hat to drive Motor and Servo :
```
DRIVE_TRAIN_TYPE = "ROBOCARSHAT"
```
- enable Hat as controller (receiving RC Channels from Hat) :
```
USE_ROBOCARSHAT_AS_CONTROLLER  = True
```
- UART to use to connect to the Hat (depends on SBC hardware and linux distro):
```
ROBOCARSHAT_SERIAL_PORT = '/dev/ttyTHS1'
``` 
- PWM Output calibration (could need adjustment to fit with actual car hardware capabilities):
```
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_OUT_THROTTLE_MIN    =   1000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_OUT_THROTTLE_IDLE   =   1500
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_OUT_THROTTLE_MAX    =   2000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_OUT_STEERING_MIN    =   1000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_OUT_STEERING_IDLE   =   1500
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_OUT_STEERING_MAX    =   2000
```
- PWN Input (see Calibration below) :
```
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_THROTTLE_MIN    =   1000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_THROTTLE_IDLE   =   1500
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_THROTTLE_MAX    =   2000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_STEERING_MIN    =   1000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_STEERING_IDLE   =   1500
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_STEERING_MAX    =   2000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_AUX_MIN    =   1000
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_AUX_IDLE   =   1500
ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_AUX_MAX    =   2000
```
- Odometry sensor raw max value (used to map Odometry raw value from [0:max value] to [0:1]:
```
ROBOCARSHAT_ODOM_IN_MAX = 20000
```
- Autonomous mode when triggered from RC (ussualy either 'local' or 'local_angle'):
```
ROBOCARSHAT_PILOT_MODE = 'local'
```
- Fix throttle to use when local_angle is engaged :
```
ROBOCARSHAT_LOCAL_ANGLE_FIX_THROTTLE = 0.2
```
- Reverse throttle to apply to brake when pilot is disengaged :
```
ROBOCARSHAT_BRAKE_ON_IDLE_THROTTLE = 0.2
```
- Disable filter on double throttle reverse sequance to engage reverse gear (depends on ESC behavior) :
```
THROTTLE_BRAKE_REV_FILTER = False
```
- Special features controled by Aux1 and Aux2  (Ch3, Ch4, depends on wiring) :
```
ROBOCARSHAT_AUX1_FEATURE = 'record/pilot'
ROBOCARSHAT_AUX2_FEATURE = 'none' 
```
- Throttle and Steering exploration increment (throttle_exploration and steering_exploration feature) :
```
ROBOCARSHAT_THROTTLE_EXP_INC = 0.05 
ROBOCARSHAT_STEERING_EXP_INC = 0.05 
```
- Steering Trim increment (output_steering_trim feature) :
```
ROBOCARSHAT_OUTPUT_STEERING_TRIM_INC = 10 
```
- Fixed steering :
```
ROBOCARSHAT_STEERING_FIX = None 
```
- discret throttling (instead of progressive throttling, cam be used to ease manual driving at 2 speed for example):
```
ROBOCARSHAT_THROTTLE_DISCRET = None 
```
- prevent car from driving too fast / lose control:
```
ROBOCARSHAT_THROTTLE_FLANGER = [-0.2,0.2] 
```
- Autocalibration of input idle (When Hat detect PWM activity on its input, first samples are considered as the actual idle value and transmitted to Donkey to adjust mapping):
```
ROBOCARSHAT_USE_AUTOCALIBRATION = True
```
- Use Odometry :
```
HAVE_ODOM = True
ENCODER_TYPE = 'ROBOCARSHAT'
```     

#### Calibration :
PWM signal is supposed to be square signal with positive pulse duration from 1ms to 2ms
This pulse width represents the 'value' carried.
For example, talking about steering, 1ms could mean to turn to the most left, and 2ms to turn to the most right
Pulse width at 1.5ms is then the theoritical idle position for the steering. This is more os less the same for the control of throttle as long as we are talking about cat (1ms means full reverse, 1.5 means idle and 2ms means full forward).
Now, a real Tx/RX signal would not stick strictly on those values. This is why qualibration is needed.

The simple way to qualibrate :
- Make sure your remote control is on idle position
- Make sure your car is on a stand, wheels being free to move in case of
- Connect the Rx Receiver to the Hat
- Connect the ESC control line to the Hat (3 Wire, neede because ESC is in charge to provide power supply to the RX Receiver)
- Power the Hat+Host
- Note the idle, minimum and maximum values reported by the Hat when actioning the remote control
- Update the following configuration items accordingly :
    - ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_THROTTLE_MIN : value reported by Hat when moving remote control to the lowest throttle value
    - ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_THROTTLE_IDLE : value reported by Hat when moving remote control to the default/idle throttle value
    - ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_THROTTLE_MAX : value reported by Hat when moving remote control to the highest throttle value
    - ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_STEERING_MIN : value reported by Hat when moving remote control to the maximum steering postion of one of the direction (the one that provides the minimum value)
    - ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_STEERING_IDLE : value reported by Hat when moving remote control to the default steering postion 
    - ROBOCARSHAT_PWM_IN_STEERING_MAX : value reported by Hat when moving remote control to the maximum steering postion of the other direction (the one that provides the maximum value)

To visualize easely value reported by the Hat, 2 possibilities according to the firmware you use :
- With ROS :
    Dump incoming messages related to radio channes :  

    ``rostopic echo /radio_channels`` 

    Messages contains an array of 4 ints : 

    ``
        ...
        data: [xxxx yyyy, aaaa, bbbb]
    ``
    
- With Simple Serial Protocol (Text Protocol) :  
    Dump incoming messages : 

    `` stty -F /dev/serial0 1000000 raw `` 

    `` cat /dev/serial0 | grep "^1," `` 
 
    Messages like ``1,xxxx,yyyy,aaaa,bbbb`` are the Radio channel messages

Throttle is the first value out of four (xxxx) 
Steering is the second value out of four (yyyy)

If you see only 1500 as value, it means that Rx Receiver PWM signal has not been detected (you should see also status LED blinking either RED or BLUE).
